BMW copied 5d_chr_500_ne30_10nodes into here. This postprocesses the joint files in /lcrc/group/e3sm/ac.wagman/E3SM_simulations/dakota/5d_chr_500_ne30 which are actually made up of runs from 5d_chr_500_ne30_10nodes, 5d_chr_500_ne30_29nodes, and 5d_chr_500_ne30_30nodes

This script works by first changing each workdirs DOUT_S_ROOT to itself, and then running case.st_archive.
Then it calls zppy.
Then it creates the targets.
If at any time you screw up completely, you can retrieve the entire ensemble from NERSC at /global/cfs/cdirs/e3sm/wagmanbe/autotune/sims/5d_chr_500_ne30
