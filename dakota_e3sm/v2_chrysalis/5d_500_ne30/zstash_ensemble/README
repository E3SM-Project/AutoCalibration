# Writes to NERSC HPSS. Simple as:
./batch_zstash_create_5d_chr_500_ne30_individ.sh 2>&1 | tee batch_zstash_create_individ.log


# How to run from https://acme-climate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ED/pages/2309226536/Running+E3SM+step-by-step+guide#2.b.ii.-Transfer-to-NERSC

$ screen # Enter screen
$ screen -ls # Output should say "Attached"
$ ./batch_zstash_create.bash 2>&1 | tee batch_zstash_create.log
# Control A D to exit screen
# DO NOT CONTROL X / CONTROL C (as for emacs). This will terminate the task running in screen!!!

$ screen -ls # Output should say "Detached"
$ hostname
# If you log in on another login node, 
# then you will need to ssh to this one to get back to the screen session.
$ tail -f batch_zstash_create.log # Check log without going into screen
# Wait for this to finish

$ screen -r # Return to screen
# Check that output ends with `real`, `user`, `sys` time information
$ exit # Terminate screen

$ screen -ls # The screen should no longer be listed
$ ls <simulations_dir>/<case_name>/zstash
# `index.db`, and a `zstash_create` log should be present
# No tar files should be listed

# If you'd like to know how much space the archive or entire simulation use, run:
$ du -sh <simulations_dir>/<case_name>/zstash
$ du -sh <simulations_dir>/<case_name>
