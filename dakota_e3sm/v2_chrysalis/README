Run E3SM from Dakota
These examples create E3SM cases but do not submit the E3SM runs.
A bundling script is included in the Chrysalis example for submitting E3SM runs. 

Before running these scripts, the user must build an E3SM case, the "parent" which will be cloned by Dakota.
Important: User must cd to the E3SM parent case
> cd $parent_ccase
> cp -r case_scripts/* .
I.e., copy the case_scripts contents one dir up into the main casedir. 
Otherwise create_clone looks for the scripts it needs in the wrong places.  

To run:
> cd ex_1.5
1. Modify paths to your E3SM code and where you want to run. At this point paths need to be modified in both run_dakota.sh and dakota_e3sm.in 
> run_dakota.sh

### What's what: ###
Adapted from Kenny Chowdary's example. 

run_dakota.sh calls the other scripts

dakota_e3sm.in instructs dakota to create the different work
directories and run the following in each work directory:

	    -run.py:        pre-process
	    -create.csh:    calls the e3sm script create_clone
	    -*inp.yml  created in each work directory from the template in *inp.yaml.template

*-inp.yaml.template has place holders for the UQ parameters set
in the *.in file. These place holders are designated with a double bracket,
i.e., "{{...}}". For each work directory, Dakota replaces these variable names
with actual numerical values.
